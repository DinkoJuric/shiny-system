Here is your field manual. No fluff. No letters. Just the tactics you need to execute.
You have the potential. Now, discipline your mind.

THE MINDSET
Math is not magic. It is a battle plan. Break the enemy (the problem) into small, weak pieces. Crush them one by one. Then, reunite the victories.


1. THE SQUARE ROOT PROTOCOL (3-Digit Numbers)
Mission: Find the root of a perfect square. 
Tactic: Squeeze the number between easy tens, then hunt the last digit.
Target: sqrt(529)
1. Establish the Perimeter (Range):
o 20 x 20 = 400 (Too small)
o 30 x 30 = 900 (Too big)
o Intel: The target is between 20 and 30.
2. Identify the Weak Point (Last Digit):
o The number ends in 9.
o What single digit times itself ends in 9?
o It is either 3 (3 x 3 = 9) or 7 (7 x 7 = 49).
3. Strike (Select the Candidate):
o Possibilities: 23 or 27.
o 529 is closer to 400 (20s) than 900 (30s).
o Strike: Guess 23.
4. Verify:
o 23 x 23 = (20+3) x (20+3).
o 400 + 120 + 9 = 529.
o Victory.
2. THE SQUARING STRIKE (Power of 2)
Mission: Multiply a number by itself.
A. The "Ends in 5" Flank (Special Case) Target: 65^2
1. The Setup: Take the first digit (6).
2. The Boost: Multiply it by the number above it.
o 6 x 7 = 42
3. The Finisher: Attach "25" to the end.
o Result: 4,225
B. The "Split & Double" Attack (General Case) Target: 42^2
1. Split the Force: Break 42 into 40 and 2.
2. Square the Heavy: 40 x 40 = 1,600
3. Square the Light: 2 x 2 = 4
4. Double the Product (Crucial Step):
o Multiply the parts: 40 x 2 = 80.
o Double it: 80 + 80 = 160.
5. Unite: 1,600 + 160 + 4 = 1,764.

3. THE CUBE CHALLENGE (Power of 3)
Mission: Multiply a number by itself, then by itself again. Warning: This is heavy lifting. Do not engage without paper unless the number is small.
Tactic: Cube the Tens, Cube the Units, fill the middle. Target: 12^3
1. Split: 10 and 2.
2. The Front: Cube the Ten (10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000).
3. The Back: Cube the Unit (2 x 2 x 2 = 8).
4. The Middle Grind:
o Zone 1: 3 x (10 x 10) x 2 = 3 x 100 x 2 = 600
o Zone 2: 3 x 10 x (2 x 2) = 3 x 10 x 4 = 120
5. Unite: 1,000 + 600 + 120 + 8 = 1,728.
Spartan Note: If this is too heavy, memorize cubes 1 through 10. Fight battles you can win.

4. MULTIPLICATION TACTIC (2 & 3 Digit Numbers)
Mission: Multiply two uneven numbers. Tactic: "Break the Line." Keep the big number whole. Break the small number apart.
Target: 123 x 12
1. Recon: 123 is the fortress. 12 is the attacker.
2. Break the Attacker: Split 12 into 10 and 2.
3. First Wave (The 10):
o 123 x 10 = 1,230 (Easy. Just add a zero.)
4. Second Wave (The 2):
o 123 x 2 = 246 (Double the number.)
5. Victory:
o 1,230 + 246 = 1,476.
Target: 32 x 21
1. Break: Split 21 into 20 and 1.
2. First Wave: 32 x 20.
o Think: 32 x 2 = 64.
o Add zero: 640.
3. Second Wave: 32 x 1 = 32.
4. Victory: 640 + 32 = 672.

FINAL ORDERS: Do not rush. Precision first. Speed later. Start training.
