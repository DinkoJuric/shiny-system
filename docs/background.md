# Project Background & Context

## Origin
The "Mental Math Trainer" (internal codename: *Synapse Spark*) began as a simple HTML prototype to help users practice arithmetic. It has since evolved into a modern React application aimed at providing a "AAA" quality educational experience.

## Core Objective
To create the most engaging, responsive, and effective mental math training tool on the web. The app separates itself from generic drills by focusing on:
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: The engine adjusts to the user's skill level in real-time.
- **Diagnostic Feedback**: Instead of just "Correct/Incorrect", the system analyzes *why* an error occurred (e.g., carrying error, sign error).
- **Premium UX**: A clean, dark-mode-first interface that feels professional and "game-like".

## Key Terminology
- **Engine**: The pure TypeScript logic layer handling math generation and difficulty adjustment.
- **Spark**: The conceptual "aha" moment we want users to feel.
- **Legacy**: The original prototype files (now archived).

## Target Audience
Students, professionals preparing for quantitative interviews, and anyone wanting to keep their brain sharp.
